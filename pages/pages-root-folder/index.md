<h1>Hi, my name is Stacy Kim.</h1>

<h2>I’m a sixth year graduate student at The Ohio State University, and I hunt for the identity of dark matter.</h2> <br>

I am currently working with Annika Peter to narrow down the zoo of possible candidates for the dark matter particle by devising stronger tests of dark matter properties by tracing how they imprint themselves onto astrophysical observables.  In particular, we’re trying to constrain self-interacting dark matter through galaxy clusters as well as scrutinizing the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way for clues concerning warm dark matter and other dark matter candidates.
