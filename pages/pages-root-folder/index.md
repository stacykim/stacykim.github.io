<h2>Hi! I’m a graduate student at The Ohio State University, and I hunt for the identity of dark matter.</h2> <br>

I am working with <a href="https://u.osu.edu/apeter/">Annika Peter</a> to narrow down the zoo of dark matter models by sharpening tests of two key dark matter properties: the small scales at which deviations occur from the canonical cold dark matter paradigm appear, and the existence of dark sector physics.  For more about my work, see the links above.
