Dark matter makes up the overwhelming majority of the matter in the Universe.  Its complex structure and dynamics play an essential role in the evolution of the remaining baryonic matter, explaining the cosmic microwave background, the clustering of galaxy clusters, and the abundance of galaxies, among others.  Observations across a vast range of scales and time point toward the existence of a relatively massive, or "cold", dark matter particle, often called cold dark matter (CDM).

The success of CDM, however, does not resolve a more fundamental question:  what particle(s) is it?  Despite significant advances in sensitivity, collider searches and indirect and direct detection experiments have yielded no positive detections of CDM-type particles, promoting the development of alternative models. Astrophysical studies suggest that it is a non-baryonic particle that is uncharged, stable to decays, and does not appear to obey any force other than gravity.  Despite these clues, its identity remains elusive, and theoretical dark matter models abound.  To constrain the allowed model space, it is imperative to develop new, more stringent tests of dark matter properties.

I have been working to sharpen tests of two key dark matter properties.  I have placed new limits on the small scales at which deviations from the canonical cold dark matter paradigm appear, and identified a novel test that may produce one of the most stringent constraints on dark matter self-interactions to date.  My work has likely ruled out potential dark matter candidates and promises to further constrain the parameter space of others, bringing us closer to the identity of the dark matter particle, one of the most pressing open questions in cosmology today.

<h2>Missing Satellites</h2>
<br>
The structural hierarchy of CDM implies that the Milky Way (MW) should have hundreds of dark matter satellites.  However, only tens of satellite galaxies have been observed---a discrepancy termed the missing satellites problem.  I showed that when accounting for invisible ``failed'' and yet unobserved faint galaxies, there are no missing satellites, and the structural hierarchy extends to at least to 10^8 solar masses.  This likely rules out the popular 7 keV sterile neutrino and places further pressure on warm dark matter thermal relics.  Testing if the structural hierarchy extends below 10^8 solar masses is essential to constrain dark matter models with a lower mass cutoff.  This will be possible with LSST and other satellite-finding techniques such as substructure lensing and perturbations to stellar streams.

<h2>Self-Interacting Dark Matter</h2>
<br>
Mergers of galaxy clusters, the largest bound structures in the universe, act as cosmic particle colliders, and are thus prime testbeds for dark sector physics. In particular, they are a unique probe of dark matter collisionality (i.e. momentum-transfer inducing self-interactions).  After two galaxy clusters collide, each cluster component---the gas, galaxies, and dark matter---separate with post-impact speeds that depend on their collisionality.  This causes the effectively collisonless galaxies to lead, while the highly collisional gas lags behind.  An offset between the dark matter and the galaxies can thus provide a measure of the strength of dark matter self-interactions, quantified by the self-interaction cross section.  However, the mapping between dark matter-galaxy offsets and the cross section had hitherto not been well studied.

I simulated a suite of equal mass cluster mergers to study this mapping.  Given current cross section limits ~1 cm^2/g, I found that offsets are small---at most ~20 kpc.  This is smaller than the measurement uncertainties, which are as large as several 10s to 100 kpc due in large part to the uncertainty in measuring the centroid of a poorly sampled galaxy distribution.  Furthermore, offsets are short lived, peaking during the cluster collision and decaying quickly after due to the restorative gravitational pull of the dark matter on the galaxies.  This contradicted the prevailing assumption that offsets continually grew after collision.  Observed offsets, which have been measured to be as large as a few 100 kpc, are likely to be a product of measurement uncertainties rather than dark matter self-interactions.

Although competitive cross-section constraints are thus unlikely to emerge from offsets, I identified a more promising constraint.  I showed that after a cluster merger, the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) oscillate in the remnant core with orbital amplitudes that depend sensitively on how strongly dark matter self-interacts.  This implies that we should see miscentered BCGs in relaxed, post-merger clusters.  Observed miscenterings are fairly small---BCGs are in fact considered the best measure of the cluster center in some studies---which indicates that this could provide one of the strongest constraints on the self-interaction cross section to date.

<h2>Giant Planet Formation</h2>
<br>
As a young gas giant approaches the mass of Jupiter, its tides becomes strong enough to clear a gap around its orbit in the protoplanetary disk from which it formed.  Its subsequent growth depends on the gas flow through the gap.  If the gas is sufficiently ionized, it may couple to magnetic fields, which can drive that flow.  In \citet{2018arXiv180404265K}, I performed Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations of the X-rays emitted from a protostar and solved a simplified gas-grain recombination reaction network to determine the ionization state of the gas in planet-opened gaps.  I then computed the magnetic diffusivities of the resultant plasma and found that while they were too high to support magneto-rotational turbulence, Hall-shear instability and potentially magneto-centrifugal winds could operate.  Importantly, the high diffusivities indicate that the non-ideal terms in the induction equation dominate the evolution of the magnetic field.  Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disks with planet-opened gaps that include these non-ideal terms are necessary to evaluate the evolution of the gas in gaps and its effects on the growth of giant planets.
