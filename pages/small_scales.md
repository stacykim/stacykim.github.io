    <h1>Problems at Small Scales</h1>
    <br>
    The structural hierarchy of CDM implies that the Milky Way (MW) should have hundreds of dark matter satellites.  However, only tens of satellite galaxies have been observed---a discrepancy termed the missing satellites problem.  I showed that when accounting for invisible ``failed'' and yet unobserved faint galaxies, there are no missing satellites, and the structural hierarchy extends to at least to 10^8 solar masses.  This likely rules out the popular 7 keV sterile neutrino and places further pressure on warm dark matter thermal relics.  Testing if the structural hierarchy extends below 10^8 solar masses is essential to constrain dark matter models with a lower mass cutoff.  This will be possible with LSST and other satellite-finding techniques such as substructure lensing and perturbations to stellar streams. <br> <br>
